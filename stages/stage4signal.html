        <p>You soldier on around the base of the mountain, fighting hunger and crushing existential dread. As the sun once again drops in the sky, you decide to burn your remaining cash in hopes someone will see the smoke. As the fire burns out, and hope seems lost, you hear shouting in the distance. Who could it be? With your lucky lately, you guess it's probably an uncontacted tribe of cannibals. But no! Jeff, your favorite bartender saw the signal fire and mounted a search party to the uninhabited side of the island. You make it back to the resort, and drown your traumatic memories in mai tais.</p>
