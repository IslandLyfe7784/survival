                <p>The tech industry is stressful! You landed you dream job and you're flush with currency, but the long hours and a client with no understanding of how Agile development works have taken their toll, and your therapist has prescribed a vacation away from it all. Unfortunately, you didn't provide your team with proper documentation, and your computer and work phone are blowing up! It seems not even a tropical paradise is an escape from work, so you ask Jeff the bartender where he goes to get away from it all. Jeff recommends a relaxing kayaking trip with the dolphins, so you rent a kayak and head out. You've never seen a dolphin in the wild before! Excitement quickly turns to fear though as suddenly the dolphins cause your kayak to capsize! You're swept up in an undersea current and you spend an untold amount of time underwater. You resurface looking at an empty beach, happy to be alive. As you swim to shore, you reflect on how much you hate dolphins.</p>
