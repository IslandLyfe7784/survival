            <p>You live off the sea, and the sea is a cruel mistress. After returning empty handed in the morning though, your luck changed. A gorgeous stranger offered to pay you $1000 up front for passage to some worthless rock! Naturally, you bought $1000 worth of rum and dropped them off, but excessive celebration lead to catastrophe! Drunk out of your mind you struck a reef and lost your ship, but you made it to shore. You begin to sober up as the sun sets.</p>
