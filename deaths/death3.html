      <p>The cave seems like the best shelter available so you venture inside. It's warm, but something smells foul. You bump into something furry, and it bleats out in surprise. A goat? You head something moving deeper in the cave, and a large pair of bright red eyes, the size of coffee cups are staring right at you. Isâ€¦is that some kind of monster? You panic and run out of the cave tripping over what must be goat carcasses. You're alive, but you'll be needing a new swimsuit.</p>
